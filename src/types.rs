 * --- Primitive types of Rust ---
 * Integers: u8, i8, u16, i16, u32, i32, u64, i64, u128, i128
 * Floats: f32, f64
 * Boolean: (bool)
 * Characters: (char)
 * Tuples
 * Arrays (are fixed length by default, for dynamic arrays use Vectors)
 * 
 * --- Introduction ---
 * Rust is a statically typed language, which means that it must know the types
 * of all the variables at compile time. However, the compiler can usually infer
 * what type we want to use based on the value and how we use it.
